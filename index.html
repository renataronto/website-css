            <p>I would like to become a software developer. Ironicly, I do not have a lot of experince working
                with computers however I really enjoy learning about it. I enjoy problem-solving and learning about
                new things. I was very happy to learn that I was accepted to this bootcamp and I hope I will be able
                to learn a lot about coding.
